# Python-Tic-Tac-Toe
Personal Project

Nothing really to say so far, just run the .py, start it going. 

It runs as a functionally complete command-line tic-tac-toe =)

TODO: Think about ways to improve the game; one idea is to give certain abilities or effect
 for certain combinations that you have a symbol on (two opposite corners, 2 adjacent spots, etc.)
